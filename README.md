This repository contains the contents for my Final Project Submission.

For part1.py when ran, the code will present a prompt along with my name and T-Number.

For part2.py when ran, the console will prompt the user to enter their first name. The if - else functions will then give the user another prompt to enter how many miles away they live which is then automatically converted into kilometers. If the user also has the same first name "Jeremy", a short secret message will be printed as if the console also has the same name as it simulates myself.

For part3.py when ran, the console will prompt the user to enter (Yes/No) if they would like to have powerball numbers. If prompted "Yes", the console will then provide the user with powerball numbers, and if prompted no, the user will be greeted to close the terminal. If any other input is used and if the response is not case-sensitive, the user will then be told to reset the terminal and try to rerun it.
